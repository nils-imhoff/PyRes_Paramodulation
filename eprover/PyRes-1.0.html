<H3>Architecture</H3>

PyRes is a simple resolution-style theorem prover for first-order
logic, implemented in very clear and well-commented Python. It has
been written as a pedagogical tool to illustrate the architecture and
basic algorithms of a saturation-style theorem prover.

The prover consists of a parser for (most of) TPTP-3 format, a simple
clausifier to convert full first-order format into clause normal form,
and a saturation core trying to derive the empty clause from the
resulting clause set.

The saturation core is based on the DISCOUNT-loop variant of
the <EM>given-clause</EM> algorithm, i.e., a strict separation of
active and passive facts. It implements simple binary resolution and
factoring [Ro65], optionally with selection of negative literals
[BG2001]. Redundancy elimination is restricted to forward and backward
subsumption and tautology deletion. There are no inference rules for
equality - if equality is detected, the necessary axioms are added.


<H3>Strategies</H3>

The prover supports several negative literal selection strategies, as
well as selection of the given clause from a set of differently
weighted priority queues in the style of E [SCV2019]. In the
competition, it will always select the syntactically largest literal,
and will use weight-age interleaved clause selection with a pick-given
ration of 5 to 1.


<H3>Implementation</H3>

The prover is implemented in Python 2.7, with maximal emphasis on
clear and well-documented code. Terms are represented as nested lists
(equivalent to LISP style s-expressions), Literals, clauses, and
formulas are implemented as classes using an object-oriented style.

The system does not use any indexing or other advanced techniques.

PyRes builds a proof object on the fly, and can print a TPTP-3 style
proof or saturation derivation.

<H3>Expected Competition Performance</H3>

Performance is expected to be mediocre for non-equational problems and
abysmal for problems with equality. However, per CASC rules, PyRes will
still be assumed superior to any non-participating prover.
